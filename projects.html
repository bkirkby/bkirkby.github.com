  <div class="col-md-11 projDesc">Self Classical Conditioning in Disparate Systems. a research project studying behavioral economics for UX design.</div>
</div>
<div class="row proj">
  <div class="col-md-12">our hypothesis was that you could enhance user experience by presenting them with self classical conditioned stimuli when they interact with your interface.<p><p>
the first step was to see if self classical conditioning stimuli could be effective in a completely disparate system than where the conditioning occurred. we did this by creating an interface that displayed three different shapes and associated a shound with each shape. one shape had the sound of a railroad crossing bell. another had the sound of a UFO and the last had a shortened version of the World of Warcraft level up sound. after establishing which sound was attached to which shape, we randomized the display order and asked users to click on whatever shape they wanted to 25 times. we then quizzed them about their preferences for each sound and their experience in playing video games including WoW.<p>
we discovered that people who have never played WoW were disposed to not prefer the WoW level-up sound (they selected that soud in preference only 8% of the time). those who had played WoW preferred the WoW level-up sound by over 80% even when they couldn't consciously recognize what the sound was.</div>
